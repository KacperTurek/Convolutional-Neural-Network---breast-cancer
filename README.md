# Convolutional Neural Network

In this project I'll show you example of using simple convolutional neural networ for image recognition.

Used image come from Keggle:

Before you head to the notebook make sure you've got all necessary packages installed. If you're missing some of them use these commands:

```javascript
pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
pip install --upgrade keras
```
Install Tensorflow from the website: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html

or
```javascript
sudo pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
sudo pip install --upgrade keras
```

Every feedback is welcome. Enjoy.
